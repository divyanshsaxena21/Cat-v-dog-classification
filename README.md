# Cat vs Dog Classification Report

## Problem Statement

In this project, we aim to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images as either cats or dogs. This task involves training a deep learning model to accurately differentiate between these two categories based on image data.

## 1. Approach Taken

### Data Understanding

Data Files:
- train_images/: Contains labeled images of cats and dogs for training.
- test_images/: Contains unlabeled images of cats and dogs for prediction.
- labels.csv: Contains the labels for the training images indicating whether each image is of a cat or a dog.

### Preprocessing Steps

1. Loading Data: Images were loaded and converted into numpy arrays using libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.
2. Image Resizing: All images were resized to a uniform dimension to ensure consistency in input size for the CNN.
3. Normalization: Pixel values were normalized to a range between 0 and 1 to improve the model’s performance.
4. Data Augmentation: Applied techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.
5. Encoding Labels: Labels were encoded into numeric format where 'cat' is represented as 0 and 'dog' as 1.

### Model Selection

- CNN Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network was selected due to its ability to learn spatial hierarchies in images. The architecture includes convolutional layers, max pooling, and dropout for regularization.

## Model Training and Evaluation

1. Train-Test Split: The dataset was split into training and validation sets to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.
2. Model Training: The CNN model was trained using the training set with techniques such as backpropagation and optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam optimizer).
3. Model Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate the model on the validation set.

### Prediction

- The trained model was used to classify images in the test dataset.
- Predictions were saved in a CSV file named `predictions.csv`, which contains the image filenames and their predicted labels.

## 2. Insights and Conclusions from Data

### Data Insights

- Image Distribution: Analyzed the distribution of images across categories to ensure balanced classes and guide the model’s learning process.
- Preprocessing Impact: Resizing and normalizing images were crucial in preparing the data for effective training.
- Data Augmentation: Enhanced the model’s ability to generalize by creating a more diverse training set.

### Model Performance

## 3. Performance on Validation Dataset

### Metrics

- Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy]%, indicating how well it classified images overall.
- Precision: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model.
- Recall: Measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified by the model.
- F1-Score: Provides a balance between precision and recall, giving a single metric to evaluate the model’s performance.

### Results

- Accuracy: The CNN model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy]%, reflecting its effectiveness in distinguishing between cats and dogs.
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Detailed metrics reveal the model’s performance in finding and correctly predicting each class.

## 4. Conclusion

### Summary

- Process: The project involved thorough data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Performance: The CNN model demonstrated strong performance in classifying images of cats and dogs.
- Validation: The model was tested on a separate validation set to ensure it generalizes well and is not overfitting.

### Next Steps
